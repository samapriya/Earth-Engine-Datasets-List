# Updated Dataset List (Included in Google Earth Engine)
The idea is to make this list machine readable so you can programmatically call assets based on filters and to have a list for users who are not yet registered but want to look at the dataset list within earth engine. Register for a free [Google Earth Engine account](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/). The table is in the form a csv file with the following setup

| id | provider                                                                           | title                                                                                                                        | start_date | end_date | startyear | endyear | type            |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| AHN/AHN2_05M_INT                                | AHN                                                                                | AHN Netherlands 0                                                                                                            | 12/31/11   | 12/31/11 | 2011      | 2011    | Image           |

The list allows for datasets to be built into a parser and we can pull these as though a dictionary for making selections before applying any other tool.
